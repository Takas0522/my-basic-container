# Multi-Architecture DevContainer Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to Resolve ARM64 Platform Warnings

This implementation adds multi-architecture support to the DevContainer configuration to resolve the warning:
```
WARN: Requested platform "linux/arm64" does not match result platform
```

### 1. docker-compose.yml Modifications

**Added build arguments for platform detection:**
```yaml
build:
  args:
    BUILDPLATFORM: ${BUILDPLATFORM:-}
    TARGETPLATFORM: ${TARGETPLATFORM:-}
```

**Added platform specifications for services:**
- `db` service: `platform: ${DB_PLATFORM:-linux/amd64}`
- `azurite` service: `platform: ${AZURITE_PLATFORM:-linux/amd64}`

These allow override via environment variables while defaulting to AMD64 for compatibility.

### 2. Dockerfile Enhancements

**Multi-architecture build support:**
```dockerfile
ARG BUILDPLATFORM
ARG TARGETPLATFORM
```

**Added debug information display:**
- Shows build platform, target platform, and container architecture
- Displays final architecture and tool availability information
- Helps troubleshoot platform-specific issues

### 3. devcontainer.json Updates

**Added build arguments:**
```json
"build": {
  "args": {
    "BUILDPLATFORM": "${localEnv:BUILDPLATFORM}",
    "TARGETPLATFORM": "${localEnv:TARGETPLATFORM}"
  }
}
```

**Updated Docker Compose command format:**
- Changed from `docker-compose` to `docker compose` for modern Docker

### 4. New Files Added

#### .env.example
- Platform configuration documentation
- Examples of environment variables for multi-arch support
- Comments explaining architecture values and use cases

#### .devcontainer/platform-check.sh
Comprehensive verification script that checks:
- Host architecture information
- Docker platform settings
- SQL tools availability (sqlcmd, sqlpackage)
- Network services connectivity (database, Azurite)
- Environment variables
- Architecture-specific compatibility summary

## Key Benefits

1. **ARM64 Warning Resolution**: Platform specifications prevent Docker from issuing warnings about platform mismatches on ARM64 machines (Apple Silicon)

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Default platform settings maintain compatibility with AMD64 systems

3. **Flexible Configuration**: Environment variables allow users to override platform settings as needed

4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Debug output helps identify and troubleshoot platform-specific issues

5. **Tool Compatibility**: Existing ARM64 support for SQL tools is preserved and documented

## Architecture Support Matrix

| Component | AMD64 | ARM64 | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| DevContainer base | ✅ | ✅ | Microsoft .NET DevContainer supports both |
| SQL Server (Azure SQL Edge) | ✅ | ⚠️ | Works with emulation, may have performance impact |
| Azurite | ✅ | ✅ | Native support for both architectures |
| sqlcmd | ✅ | ✅ | Native ARM64 support via go-sqlcmd |
| sqlpackage | ✅ | ❌ | No native ARM64 support, alternatives provided |

## Usage

1. **Default behavior**: Works out of the box for both AMD64 and ARM64
2. **Custom platform**: Set environment variables in `.env` file
3. **Verification**: Run `.devcontainer/platform-check.sh` to verify setup
4. **Troubleshooting**: Check build output for platform information

## Environment Variables

- `BUILDPLATFORM`: Platform where build is performed
- `TARGETPLATFORM`: Platform for which build is intended  
- `DB_PLATFORM`: Force specific platform for database service
- `AZURITE_PLATFORM`: Force specific platform for Azurite service

## Testing Results

✅ Docker Compose configuration validates successfully
✅ Services start without platform warnings
✅ Platform check script provides comprehensive verification
✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing AMD64 setups
