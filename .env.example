# BUILDPLATFORM=linux/amd64
# TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64

# Database platform (Azure SQL Edge)
# Note: Azure SQL Edge officially supports AMD64, but may work on ARM64 with emulation
# DB_PLATFORM=linux/amd64

# Azurite platform (Azure Storage Emulator)

# TARGETPLATFORM - Platform for which the build is intended

# Common platform values:
# - linux/amd64 (Intel/AMD 64-bit)
